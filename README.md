## Problem
Our clients take part in a program that encourages clinicians and patients to make a shared decision about the treatment that the patient will receive. Our clients have worked closely together with clinicians
and collected the most common questions that patients ask about their treatment option. They have collected data
on several mental health conditions. During the design sprint we work with the data collected on depression.


### User journey:

As a clinician,  
dealing with  young patients I would like to have an app  
to help them make decisions about their treatment or care for depression.  

### User stories:

As a clinician,  
I should be able to view the App on a desktop, mobile or tablet,  
as I may only have access one of these devices at my practice.  

As a clinician,  
I would like to see a brief description about the condition of Depression and the purpose of the app,  
so that my patient would understand why they're using it.  

As a clinician,  
I would like to present unbiased  options to my patient,  
so they don't feel pressured to choose one option over the other.  

As a young person suffering from depression,  
I would like be able to navigate the App myself,  
so I can easily explore the options for my treatment.  

As a young person suffering from depression,  
I would like to be able to keep track of the options I am interested in,  
so I can discuss them with my clinician afterwards.  

### Future plans:
- make a progressive web app with an indexDB database, so that the app would work
without internet connection.
- we worked with a shortened question set, implement the extended one for depression.
- implement the animated version of talking therapy and medication for depression.
- implement both the animated and plain version of the treatments for
 the other conditions like ADHD, challenging behaviour, self-harm, low mood and anxiety.
